# Bug Fix: LocationSearch Export Error

## 🐛 Issue

**Error Message:**
```
Module '"../components/LocationSearch/index"' declares 'LocationSearch' locally, 
but it is not exported.ts(2459)
```

**Location:** `MapSelectionScreen.tsx` line 8

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

Two issues were causing the export error:

1. **Missing Export Statement**: The `LocationSearch` component was missing the `export default` statement at the end of the file
2. **Incorrect Import Syntax**: `MapSelectionScreen.tsx` was using named import `{ LocationSearch }` instead of default import

---

## ✅ Solution

### Fix 1: Added Missing Export
**File:** `src/components/LocationSearch/index.tsx`

**Added at line 227:**
```typescript
export default LocationSearch;
```

### Fix 2: Corrected Import Statement
**File:** `src/screens/MapSelectionScreen.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { LocationSearch } from '../components/LocationSearch/index';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import LocationSearch from '../components/LocationSearch';
```

### Fix 3: Added to Components Index (Bonus)
**File:** `src/components/index.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
export { default as LocationSearch } from './LocationSearch';
export { default as RadiusSlider } from './RadiusSlider';
```

Now you can import LocationSearch in two ways:
```typescript
// Direct import (what we're using)
import LocationSearch from '../components/LocationSearch';

// Or from components index
import { LocationSearch } from '../components';
```

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/LocationSearch/index.tsx` - Added `export default`
2. ✅ `src/screens/MapSelectionScreen.tsx` - Fixed import statement
3. ✅ `src/components/index.ts` - Added LocationSearch and RadiusSlider exports

---

## 🧪 Verification

All TypeScript errors resolved:
- ✅ `LocationSearch/index.tsx` - No errors
- ✅ `MapSelectionScreen.tsx` - No errors
- ✅ `components/index.ts` - No errors

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

When I initially created the LocationSearch component, the `export default LocationSearch;` line was accidentally removed during the last edit (when fixing the filter error). This is a common issue when doing large replace operations.

---

## 🎯 What Works Now

- ✅ LocationSearch component properly exported
- ✅ MapSelectionScreen can import LocationSearch
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Component available from components index
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Restart the Metro bundler if needed:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. Test the MapSelectionScreen to ensure LocationSearch renders correctly

3. Test both text search and current location button

**Status: FIXED ✅**
